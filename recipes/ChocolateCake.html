    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin, but that's okay.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once the cakes are completely cooled, frost with your favorite chocolate frosting.</li>
        <li>Optional: Decorate with chocolate shavings or sprinkles.</li>
        <li>Slice, serve, and enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate cake!</li>
